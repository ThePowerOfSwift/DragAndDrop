# DragAndDrop

A drag and drop project to exercise Object Oriented Design Principles
The app should be simpel to limit complexity and focus on Design Principles and Separation of concerns.

## Simplicity
This iOS Application will include 
  * One Screen
  * One Draggable element
  * One Target Area
When the draggable item is moved to the target are something cool should happen.

The idea here is that this should give us enough moving pieces to work with objects and to move functionality around, without too much needless complexity.

## Previous Implimentations
I build this project on my own and in the end had a Nice Touch and drag animation supported by 3 classes. 

ViewController - To handle and forward on touch interations.
PanHandler - To handle pan interactions.
Animator - To animate the UI when the pan complete. 

I am really excited about working on this project further with some peers and to see what we come up with.
